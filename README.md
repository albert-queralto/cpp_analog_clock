# Analog Clock build using C++ and Raylib

This is a simple analog clock built using C++ and the Raylib library. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands, and updates in real-time.

The code is based on the tutorial from [Programming with Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_hg96tixLM).
